So i created this repository only for SQL projects and Blogs or queries </p>

So I participated in a contest of digits n data where we have to creaft sql queries from given data.

Lakshadweep and Maldives SQL Analysis Case Study that is provided by Digits n Data.

In this data bases i have four tables

destinations
Indiantourists
touristarrival
touristattractions

so we have to craft SQL queries for the questions that they gave us

Que.1 Retrieve the number of visitors to the Maldives

Que.2 Retrieve the average budget per day and best time to visit destinations with more than 10,000 tourists in 2022.

Que.3 Retrieve the unique features of tourist attractions in Lakshadweep.

Que.4 Retrieve the number of Indian tourists who visited the Maldives in 2021.

Que.5 Find the destinations with the highest tourism revenue in 2022.</p>

 I will provide the sql file and the solution pdf also.
